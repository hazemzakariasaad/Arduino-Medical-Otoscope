# Arduino-Medical-Otoscope
This project implements an Arduino-based medical otoscope, which is a device used for examining the ear canal and eardrum. The otoscope incorporates an LED light source and a light-dependent resistor (LDR) sensor to control the intensity of the light based on the ambient light level.

# Hardware Setup
The hardware setup for the medical otoscope includes the following components:

Arduino board (such as Arduino Uno)
LED (connected to digital pin 5)
Light-dependent resistor (LDR) sensor (connected to analog pin A0)

# Code Functionality
The code provided controls the LED light source based on the ambient light level sensed by the LDR sensor. Here's a breakdown of the code's functionality:

1.Initialization: The setup() function runs once during power-up or reset. It initializes the serial communication and sets the LED pin (pin 5) as an output and the LDR pin (A0) as an input.

2.Main Loop: The loop() function runs repeatedly and contains the main code.

3.Reading Light Intensity: The intensity of the ambient light is read using the analogRead() function on the LDR pin. The raw analog-to-digital conversion (ADC) value is obtained.

4.Light Calculation: The Light() function converts the raw ADC value to a lux value representing the light intensity. The calculation depends on the specific characteristics of your LDR and the voltage divider setup used.

5.LED Control: Based on the calculated light intensity, the code determines whether to turn on or off the LED light source. If the light intensity is below a threshold (65 lux in this code), the LED is turned on. Otherwise, it is turned off. The digitalWrite() function is used to control the LED pin.

6.Serial Output: The code outputs the current light intensity in lux to the serial monitor. This can be helpful for monitoring and debugging purposes.

7.Delay: The code includes delay periods (550ms and 850ms) to control the timing of LED switching and serial output. You can adjust these values based on your specific requirements.

# Usage
To use the Arduino-based medical otoscope:

1.Set up the hardware by connecting the LED and LDR sensor to the designated Arduino pins as described in the hardware setup section.
2.Upload the provided code to your Arduino board using the Arduino IDE or other compatible software.
3.Open the serial monitor in the Arduino IDE or a serial terminal application to view the light intensity readings.
4.Place the otoscope in the ear canal and observe the LED light intensity variations based on the ambient light level.
5.Please note that this project provides a basic implementation of an otoscope and can be further enhanced and customized based on specific requirements and use cases.
